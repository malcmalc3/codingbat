/* Start with two arrays of strings, A and B, each with its elements in
 * alphabetical order and without duplicates. Return a new array containing 
 * the first N elements from the two arrays. The result array should be in 
 * alphabetical order and without duplicates. A and B will both have a length 
 * which is N or more. The best "linear" solution makes a single pass over A 
 * and B, taking advantage of the fact that they are in alphabetical order, 
 * copying elements directly to the new array.

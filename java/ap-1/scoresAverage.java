/* Given an array of scores, compute the int average of the first half and the
 * second half, and return whichever is larger. We'll say that the second half 
 * begins at index length/2. The array length will be at least 2. To practice 
 * decomposition, write a separate helper method <br>int average(int[] scores, 
 * int start, int end) { which computes the average of the elements between 
 * indexes start..end. Call your helper method twice to implement 
 * scoresAverage().

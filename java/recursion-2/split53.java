/* Given an array of ints, is it possible to divide the ints into two groups,
 * so that the sum of the two groups is the same, with these constraints: all 
 * the values that are multiple of 5 must be in one group, and all the values 
 * that are a multiple of 3 (and not a multiple of 5) must be in the other. 
 * (No loops needed.)

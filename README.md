These are my solutions to challenge problems found on http://codingbat.com

To test out my slutions, the text from each file can be copied and pasted into
the challenge problem on the website that matches up with the name of the program.

I started working on these challenges in 2013, when I first started to learn
how to code. With that being said, my solutions to earlier challenges may
have bad coding practices, or an inefficient way of solving the problem.

Code that closely reflect my locig and coding practices can be found in later
challenges, such as those contained in the String-3 or Array-2 folders.
